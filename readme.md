=============


Getting Started:

Ideafy is a website where you can post any idea that comes to your mind. Website visitors can like or dislike the idea. They can also add their arguments as to why they like or dislike the idea. These arguments can be voted up or down by other users. The argument with the most upvotes is featured at the top of the pane in a prominent position.

Users must be active on the site for a set amount of time before they can post an idea of their own. Ie. they must have posted arguments on other ideas that have gotten a set number of upvotes. This creates an incentive for users to provide feedback, and again creates higher quality comments/engagement.

Users will be ranked hierarchially based on how many ideas they've posted, how popular those ideas have been, and there level of activity on the site.
